# Changelog

## Unreleased

- 2025-10-18: Use timezone-aware UTC datetimes across the codebase for audit, workflow, budget, and security timestamps. This reduces deprecation warnings from third-party libraries and ensures JWT expiries and serialized timestamps include timezone info.
- 2025-10-18: Harden authentication with rate-limited `/auth/token`, audit logging for all attempts, and scheduler lifecycle guards. Added AI interface documentation and refreshed architecture notes.
- 2024-10-19: Establish repository governance, developer tooling (pre-commit, EditorConfig, commitlint), and CI/CD scaffolding (GitHub Actions, Renovate) without behavioural changes.
